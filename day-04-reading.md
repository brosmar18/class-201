## Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside the `<a></a>` element.
2. The `href` attribute specifies the absolute or relative location of a file.
3. To make links accessible for all readers, we can use descriptive link text to provide a clear description of the content it links to.

## CSS Layout

1. Normal flow refers to the default layout behavior of elements. When a page is first loaded, all elements are positioned in their default position as indicated by the HTML code.
2. A key difference between block-level and inline elements include: Block-level elements take up the full width avaiable on the page and start on a new line, while inline elements only take up as much width as their content and remain on the same line.
3. Static positioning is the default for every html element. Elements are displayed in the normal flow of the document, and their positions are determined by their order in the HTML code and the default margin and padding values.
4. Advantages to using absolute positioning on an element are: Control over element placement, allows you to cretae overlapping content, such as a drop-down menu, and allows you to access the z-index of an element.
5. The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that absolute positioning places an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor while in fixed positioning, the element is placed relative to the viewport.

## Learn JS

1. A function declaration is used to define a function, while a function invocation is used to actually call a function and pass in arguments.
2. A parameter is a variable defined in a function's declaration that represents a value that the function expects to receive when it is called. An argument, is the actual value that is passed into a function when its called.

## Misc.

1. Two benefits of pair programming is improved code quality and knowledge sharing. This can be very helpful as we're learning to code because with two people looking at the same code we can catch errors and improve codee readability.
