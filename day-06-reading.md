## JavaScript Object Basics

1. An Object can be thought of as a box full of different things that are related and you want to keep together.
2. Advantages of creating object literals are:
   a. They are easy to create.
   b. They are flexible and dynamic so you can add, remove or modify items.
3. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for a value. An array is a collection of values, where each value has an index that represents its position in the array.
4. Bracket notation would be needed to access an object's property instead of dot notation when the property name contains special characters such as spaces or hyphens, and when a property is stored as a variable.
5. The term `this` refers to the `name` and `age` properties of the `dog` object. Using `this` allows the function to access and use the object's properties dynamically, which means that the function can be used on any object that has the same set of properties, not just the `dog` object.

## Introduction to the DOM

1. The DOM (Document Object Model), is a programming interface for web documents. It is a tree-like representation of an HTML document that allows developers to manipulate and modify the content and structure of a web page using JS.
2. JavaScript manimulates the DOM to create dynamic web pages. JS allows you to access and modify the content, structure, and style of the page.
