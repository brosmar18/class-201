# Day 3 Reading: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Modela

## HTML: Ordered and Unordered lists.

1. You should use an unordered list when the order that the items are displayed does not matter.
2. You can change the bullet style of unordered list items by using the `list-style-type` property in CSS. This properfty will specify the type of list item marker. Possible markers are `circle`, `square`, `upper-roman`, and `lower-alpha`.
3. You should use an ordered list instead of an unorderd list, when the order that the items are displayed are important.

## CSS: The Box Model

1. If `margin` and `padding` where characters in a story called "The Box Model", `margin` would be described as the space keeper between important structures outside of their borders. `padding` is the inner space keeper maintaining the space between a structure and their border.
2. The four html elements described by the box model are: `margins`, `borders`, `padding`, and actual content.

## JS: Arrays, Oerators and expressions, Conditionals, and Loops

1. An array in JS can store any data type including strings, numbers, boolean, functions, undefined, and null.
2. The people array `const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];` is valid in JS because js allows you to mix data types in an array and also to create a multidimensional array. You can access the elements by specifying an index twice. **Example**: `let value1 = people[0][0]`. value1 will equal 'pete'.
3. 5 shorthand operators are `x += f()` meaning x = x + f(), `x -= f()` meaning x = x + f(), `x *= f()` meaning x = x \* f(), `x /= f()` meaning x = x / f(), and `x **= f()` meaning x = x \*\*f().
4. When you add a number with a string the result will be a string. THe result of the expression will be '10dog'.
5. A real would example when a conditional statement should be used in a JS program would be a daily planner app that reminds you to bring an umbrella if there is a chance of rain that day.
