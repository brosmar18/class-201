## Troubleshooting JS

1. Syntax errors and logic errors are two types of errors that can occur in programming with JavaScript. A syntax error happens when the code violates the syntax rules of the programming language, such as missing a required punctuation mark or a keyword. These errors prevent the code from running and are typically caught by the compiler or interpreter before the code is executed. In contrast, a logic error happens when the code runs but produces the wrong output due to a flaw in the program's logic or algorithm. These errors can be more challenging to identify and fix because the code executes without any syntax errors, but the output is not what was expected.
2. Common errors encountered in lab are syntax errors. Often, a mispelled word or a missing item of the syntax is the only thing preventing the code from running.
3. This topic will continue to influence my long term goals as understanding errors and how to fix them, will be a valuable skill in a career.

## The JS Debugger

1. The JS debugger took helps developers find and dix errors in their JS code. It allows developers to pause the execution of their code at a specific point and inspect the state of the variables and functions at that moment. It also allows developers to step through their code line by line, to see how it executes and to identify any errors that occur. This tool is particularly helpful for beginners as it provides an interactive way to debug their code and understand how it works.
2. A breaking point is a point in the code where the executio of the program is intentionally paused, so that the developer can examine the state of the code at that point.
3. The call stack is a mechanism for keeping track of the order in which functions are called in a program. Whenever a function is called, a new frame is added to the top of the call stack, which contains information about the function, including its arguments and local variables. The function then executes, and when it returns, the frame is removed from the top of the stack, and control returns to the previous function on the stack. The call stack allows the program to keep track of where it is in the execution of the code, and what functions are currently active. The call stack is an essential component of the debugging process, as it allows developers to trace the execution of the code and identify where errors are occurring.
