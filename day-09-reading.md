## HTML Forms

1. Forms are important because they provide a way for users to interact with a website, provide information, and submit data.
2. When designing a form, user experience can be improvided by having a clear and straighforward form with a clear layout and easy-to-understand instructions. Lengthy forms can be overwhelming and discouraging. Clear and descriptive labels can help users understand what info is required in each field. Providing immediate feedback when users submit the form, such as a confirmation message can help users feel more confident that their info was submitted.
3. 5 form elements include: Text input - allow users to enter text, such as their name. Checkboxes - allow users to select one or more options form a list. Radio button - similar to radio boxes but users can only select one option from a list. Dropdown meunu - allow users to select one option from a list that is dispalyed when they click on the menu. Submit button - Used to send the data entered into the form to the server for processing.

## Learn JS

1. Events are like triggers taht are fired when someething happenson a webpage. These triggers could be things like a user clicking a button, typing into a form, or scrolling the page. WHen an event is trggered, JS can be used to run a function or a series of functions that can change what is displayed on the webpage or perform other actions, like sending data to a server or animating an element.
2. When using the addEventListener() method, the first argument is a string that specifies the type of event you want to listen for. Such as "click", "keydown", or "submit". The second argument is a function that will be called when the event is triggered. This function is referred to as an event handler, and it can contain any JS code that you want to run in response to the event.
3. An event object is created when an event is triggered on a webpage. Contains info about the event, such as the type of event, the element that triggered the event, andnany additional data related to the event. The "target" property refers to the element that triggered the event. This is useful because it allows you to access and manipulate the element that caused the event to occur.
4. Event bubbling and event capturing are two different ways in which events are propagated through the DOM tree in JS. Event capturing occurs during the "capturing phase" of event propagation, which happens before the actual event is triggered on the target element. During this phase, the event is first captureed by the outermost element in the DOM hierarchy and then progressively moves toward the target element. Event bubbling, occurs during the "bubbling phase" of event propagation, which happens after the event has been ttriggered on the target element. The event bubbles through the DOM hierarchy, starting from the target element and progressively moving towards the outermost element.
