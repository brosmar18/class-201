## Domain Modeling

1. We need domain modeling because it allows us to understand the problem. Bcreating a visual representation of the problem domain, we can gain a better understanding of the problem we are trying to solve. Domain modeling also allows us to communicate our understanding of the problem to others and design effective solutions.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Tables should not be used to create page layouts because they are difficult to navigate for people with visual or mobility impairments who rely on screen readers. Tables can be difficult to maintain and update and are problematic for responsive design.
2. Semantic elements are used to provide meaning and structure to the content of a web page. A `<header>` is an element used to define the top section of a webpage, typically containing the logo, navigation, and other introductory content. A `<main>` element is used to define the main content area of a webpage where the most important content of the page is located. A `<footer>` element is used to define the bottom section of a webpage that typically contains copyright info, contact details, and other supplementary info.

## Introducing Constructors

1. A constructor is a function used to create and initialize objects. A constructor function is called when an object is created using the `new` keyword.
2. The keyword `this` refers to the object that the funcdtion or method is called on. When `this` is called in an object literal, it refers to the object itself. When `this` is used in a constructor, it refers to the new object that is being created.

## Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

1. Prototypes and inheritence in JS are similar to providing treatments and medications to patients. Even though patients have unique needs, they can benefit from shared treatments. Objects can have unique properties but can share common methods and properties via prototypes and inheritance.
